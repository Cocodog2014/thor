# GlobalMarkets Models

- `market.py` — Core Market model with timezone, open/close times, trading_days gate, and session capture flags.
- `us_status.py` — TradingCalendar (USMarketStatus alias) for exchange-specific holidays/trading days.
- Other models are legacy structures referenced by migrations and admin.
