FutureTrading.models package

Novice-friendly structure:
- rtd.py        → Real-time data models (existing instruments, weights, etc.)
- market_open.py→ Market-open capture models (to be added in Phase 1)

This __init__ re-exports models so imports like
`from FutureTrading.models import TradingInstrument` continue to work.
